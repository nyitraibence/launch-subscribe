# Subscribe App ðŸ“§
A super lightweight PHP + SQLite application, that lets people subscribe for your site before it launches.


## Setup
Open the ``/admin.php`` route, and it automatically creates the database and neccessary tables. Then you're good to go. That's it.

Client endpoints:
- index.php
- admin.php

Feel free to extend the application. It ships with basic functionality and barebone styling. Enjoy. 

## Tasks left
- Privacy policy - for storing emails
- Language session / language url
